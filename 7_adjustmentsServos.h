/* SERVO OUTPUT SETTINGS ************************************************************************************************
 *  
 * The CH1 - CH6 headers are used as outputs in BUS communication mode (SBUS, IBUS, PPM)
 * This allows to use as super compact "bus-only" receiver
 * Set the endpoints here in 1000 - 2000 microseconds (equal to -45 to 45Â° servo angle)
 * !! WARNING: Don't connect a receiver to the "CH1 - CH6" headers, if BUS communication is selected. Ihis will short them out!!
 * 
 * Uncommenting "#define SERVO_DEBUG" in the main tab allows to calibrate the servo positions easily:
 * 1. select the "SERVOS_DEFAULT" servo configuration
 * 2. upload the sketch
 * 3. connect the servo you want to calibrate to the steering channel CH2 on the sound controller
 * 4. turn your steering wheel until you cave the position you want
 * 5. write down the microseconds reading, which is displayed in the Arduino IDE serial monitor
 * 6. do it for every position
 * 7. make a servo configuration profile, using these values
 * 8. select this profile and upload the sketch
 * 9. that's it!
